# login-system

An example of a basic login system using a React frontend, and a NodeJS backend using mysql.

### How to start 

First, from the root directory have two terminal windows ready. In the first change dir into the <b>web</b> folder, and run `yarn start`.
You will now need to start the mysql server, if you have mysql installed on your macOS you can open system preferences and run it from there. Otherwise you could use the mysql CLI tools to begin the server.
Then in the second terminal window change dir into the <b>backend</b> folder, and run `yarn start`.
You've now got both the frontend, and backed running :tada:
